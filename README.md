## Personal Introduction

### Hi there! I'm Jayden-Lee Van Rooyen 👋

I'm a **Computer Science Honors** student at **The University of the Western Cape**. I am passionate about **machine vision** and leveraging it to solve real-world problems. My ultimate goal is to become a **Machine Learning Researcher for Boston Dynamics**.

When I'm not in the coding, you'll find me exploring the world of Pokémon (my favorite series) or hitting a new PR in the gym. 🏋️‍♂️🎮
